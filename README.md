# MemoirBuk

MemoirBuk is an android app based on practical applications of a recent research in Behavioral Economics by Kahneman and Tversky. To capture special moments in a person's life, we enable them to click a picture and attach a sound/recording with it, generate a video consisting of several pictures and their respective recordings or a new recording all together (that can be done using a bit of customisations within the app) and share the videos and pictures with friends and family.
